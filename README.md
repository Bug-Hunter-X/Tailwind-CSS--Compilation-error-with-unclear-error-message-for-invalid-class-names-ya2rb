# Tailwind CSS Compilation Error with Unclear Error Messages

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: encountering compilation errors due to invalid class names, where the error message is not always helpful in pinpointing the problem.

## Problem

When an invalid class name is used in your component's className prop, the Tailwind CSS build process might throw an error. However, the error message isn't always specific enough to immediately identify the offending class. This can lead to time wasted debugging.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing your class names.  Tailwind's JIT mode can help, but sometimes even with JIT errors can be cryptic. Thoroughly inspect your code for typos or incorrect class names. If possible, use a linter that checks for valid Tailwind class names or use a plugin that provides autocompletion of these class names.
